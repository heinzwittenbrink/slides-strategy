## Common understanding

> Content strategy always works by creating a common understanding.

> Content strategists do not simply propose an "objectively correct" diagnosis and therapy to an organization as external experts, but develop a common understanding with and within an organization or community that works in practice.

## Many and diverse factors

As a content strategist, you combine different disciplines in a strategy tailored to an individual case.

---

Content strategy is not a super science or super discipline. It is an art that uses the appropriate boxes depending on the situation.

---

For the work of content strategists and the understanding of the discipline, this means that only a non-reduced concept of content strategy can be practically successful.

## VMOSA

- V for Vision,
- M for mission,
- O for Objectives also goals

## Dependence on organizational goals

> When trying to develop content strategy, we find the larger organizational (or website, or product) strategies—or, worse, goals—aren’t clearly defined.

(Kristina Halvorson)


## Vision

A vision statement has the task to get a common understanding of where you actually want to go.

## Mission

> Your mission statement succinctly states what you exist to do

(Kristina Halvorson)

## Goals

> Goals are long-term, concrete outcomes that contribute to the fulfillment of your mission

(Kristina Halvorson)

## Strategy

Only when I have defined such goals do I need a strategy. The strategy consists of a sequence of coordinated actions to achieve these goals.

---

> Strategy is where you will focus your efforts to achieve your goals, and how you will succeed—or, “where to play and how to win.”

(Kristina Halvorson)

---

> It defines a specific course of action that will take you from where you are now to where you want to be.

(Kristina Halvorson)

---

> In fact, one of strategy’s primary roles is to set constraints on the work you’ll do

(Kristina Halvorson)


## Objectives and targets

> Objectives are specific outcomes that map back to your strategy.

---

> Targets are the metrics you use to measure whether or not an objective has been achieved.
